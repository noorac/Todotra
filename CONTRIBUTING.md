Rules for CONTRIBUTING

Todotra is my take on the classical todo-list, a program many developers make early in their career.

Because this is a learning experience for me, both in using git and in programming, any chance to learn is welcome, and
therefore also contributions. However, this should be done respectfully and ideally newbie friendly. I also welcome 
critique, but again, this should be done respectfully. 

Also, keep in mind I am learning to create CONTRIBUTING.md files here, so this file is probably incomplete.

Thank you
